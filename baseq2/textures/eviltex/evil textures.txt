[INFO]
Recommended practice when using custom textures, in order to avoid collisions:

- always place them in the directory structure textures/mymap/
- rename them if necessary
- distribute what you used in your pak file

[STUFF]
-If you use any of the textures please email me, the author and possibly Cyber-Freak, with the
url to some screenshots if possible. I (we) really would like to
see what uses mappers have made of them.
