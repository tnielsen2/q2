   Zip File Contents : scripts/lunbase.shader is an unmodified version of the shader included
                       with the original release of Lun3DM2.  There's nothing new in here.
                     : lunbase/ contains all textures included with the original release of 
                       Lun3DM2.  There's nothing new in here, either.  However ...
                     : sources/ contains several of the Photoshop files, unflattened, that I
                       used to make the various textures in LDBST.  Not all of them are here,
                       but all the base materials (slab, onyx, tech, and crete), the PSD for 
                       the concrete walls, walls w/the 6-sided black panel, and the jumppads 
                       are included, which is enough to get anyone with experience in Photoshop 
                       on his way expanding the set however he may need.

               Notes : DO NOT e-mail me asking for help making your own textures or using 
                       Photoshop.  I'm providing these files with the assumption that you know
                       what to do with them.  I will not provide tutorials, guidance, or extra
                       material, and if I still get e-mails about it, I will trash them unread.
