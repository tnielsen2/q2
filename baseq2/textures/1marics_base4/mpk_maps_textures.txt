*notes 
      
    These are two maps made from a common "unusual" texture set. The idea is that
    we will have a "community" map pak made from this set, all having a semi-common visual     theme... Maybe? Anyway, these are the two example maps, the r_speeds are ridiculoud but
    I wanted to convey the possibilities...
                       


*INSTALLATION*

       if you got this zip file intact just aim this puppy at your baseq2
               folder and let 'er rip.
