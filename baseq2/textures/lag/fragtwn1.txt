                          c:\quake2\baseq2\textures

                          Copy the Fragtwn1.dm2 file into the demos directory.  
                          Copy Fragtwn1.BSP and Fragtwn1.map into the maps directory.  
                          Copy all of the textures (i.e. *.wal) files into the textures 
                          directory.

                          console.  To load the map type "MAP FRAGTWN1" at the quake
