Industrial/sci-fi greyish textures made with q3 in mind. Mapper-friendly (at least for me ;))
.shader included

Instructions / INSTALLATION 

1. Extract the zip file in the BASEQ3 directory keeping the folder structure
(or just move it there and rename from .zip to pk3)
2. Goto the SCRIPTS sub-directory under the BASEQ3  and in the file SHADERLIST.TXT   
add the line at the bottom (the name of the .sahder) : speedtech


Please check all individual shaders for additional textures
because some light fixtures share the same blend texture.

____________________________________

If you change anything, create a new shader file
and use unique shaders names and paths please,
to avoid possible problems. 

If you use my textures, please give me credit and mention my site URL. 

If you modify any of the textures, they still remain my property!
