"Can I use your textures in my Quake3 map?"

-- sure, everyone is more than welcome to use any and all of my textures and shaders in projects for any game as long as the project is not being sold. If you do use any of my textures I would appreciate a link to my web site and proper credite given in any text files or documentation included with your project.

Thanks,
