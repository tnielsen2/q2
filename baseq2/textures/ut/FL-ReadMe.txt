Flamel.utx and/or Flamel Bitmap/TGA Archive
rtDetail.utx and/or rtDetail bitmap Archive


* Installation:

Unzip the .utx files into your "UT/Textures" folder, and you will be good to go. Flamel.utx is dependent on rtDetail, so both packs must be in the same directory.

* Desideratum

For those who are curious, I used photoshop exclusively to create these textures. Flamel is my second texture pack, created to fit seemlessly with the architecture of the Fleshdance map, Dm-Flamel, also available at my site. Special thanks to Fleshdance for collaborating with me on this project and being such as hardass about what he wanted . . . visit his site at http://www.unreality.org/fleshdance.
