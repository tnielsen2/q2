rtDetail / rtarbor.utx and/or arbor Bitmap/TGA Archive


* Installation:

Unzip the .utx files into your "UT/Textures" folder, and you will be good to go. rtArbor.utx is dependent on rtDetail, so both packs must be in the same directory.

* Desideratum

Full of wood, rock and other "natural" sundries, arbor is my second texture pack - -and some of the work isn't as good as could be . . . however, there is some really handy surface in there and I hope they are put to good use. This is another pack I want to follow up on, as a kind of grudge match.
