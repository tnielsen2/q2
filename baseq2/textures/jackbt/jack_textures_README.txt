Phil Baxter ,Aidan Wilson & Jack Couvela for putting me on the 'Photoshop Path' last
year at Reflections. Turning to the Dark side of the force was the best thing I ever did.
George Orwell for writing 1984.
And thanks to all those that gave me permission to use their websites logos.


.> Questions you may have <.



Can I use the Textures?
If you include one of the 'Signature' textures in a level constructed
with the Jackboot textures you can use them freely. I hope people use only the Jackboot
textures in a level rather than mixing with other level textures but as long as I get credited
for their creation  with teh sig texture and a word in the txt file thats fine by me.



.> Things you should know >.

I made these level textures for my Quake2 level Jackboot, it can be downloaded from my site as can a Q1 and Q3 version (eventually)
 Its inspiration was the film by George Orwell '1984' and my recently learning that the Director 
of the film was from the same town I am in Scotland called Stranraer.
Also shades of the Watchmen creeped in near the end.
If your looking for a name to put to the style of textures and look of the Jackboot map then call it
'Steampunk'. Thats what i call it. Its Cyberpunk but retro style, which is if anything 'Steampunk'
As a style its beginnings can be charted back to films like Metropolis, Brazil, Tetsuo2, City of
the lost children and is coming back in a big way with films like the Matrix and Dark City now
winning popularity in the cinema.
