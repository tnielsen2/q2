These textures are in wal format for use in Quake2 level editing. The set was originally designed for use in an Unreal level. The level was based on the theme of a Celtic shrine which had been burned and ransacked. There are approximately 45 original textures in this set which I personally created. You may use these textures in your own Quake2 map for personal enjoyment only. You may NOT use any of these wal files for commercial purposes without my written permission. When distributing this textures please distribute them together in their original form and with this txt file. Thank you.
