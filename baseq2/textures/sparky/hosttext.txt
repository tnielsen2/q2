======================== Textures ==========================

The basis for the carpet texture in the president's office was
a texture from Sonya Roberts' "Fearical", and the paintings on
the wall in that room were from Sonya Roberts' "Artworks". A good
deal of work was put into tweaking these textures for Q2.

Most of the textures were done completely from scratch by me,
a few were gathered from public-domain texture sites and
converted with great difficulty to Q2.

======================= Other Info =========================

Wally kicks ass.

Note that wood2.wal in the quake2/textures/custom directory
is also mine. This is a stupid error on my part, but it must
be included for my map to run properly (doh!). Do not use this
texture yourselves! Use instead the wood textures in the
textures/sparky directory. There should be one that is almost
exactly the same.

Furthermore, the door textures double up with mirror images.
This is not an error on my part. Quake2 (or maybe just Qoole)
likes to screw with textures that are "flipped" on rotating
doors, offsetting them by about 4 pixels or so. As a result,
I had to double up on the door textures to get them right.
Sorry.
