Intro
-----
Please read this entire file, as it contains important info on installation.
Many options have changed/been added in this version, so please double check
everything, even if you are just upgrading.
Also, be sure to read the readme.txt included in the client package.

-------------------------
Installation Instructions
-------------------------
This is the server package for Rocket Arena 2. You will also need the client
pak (a seperate download) installed on the server. Download it and install
according to the included instructions.
Please note that on Unix machines you may need to rename the client EXE file
to a ZIP file and unzip it manually.

Extract all of the files to your \quake2\arena directory.

You can put the raserver.bat in your \quake2 directory.

Customize the server.cfg to your tastes. It includes the admincode (see below)
which will allow for in-game configuration of the mod. Please change this
code!

Please see below for info on the arena.cfg file, used to customize settings
on a per server/per level/per arena basis. 
It includes map rotation information as well.

Customize the raserver.bat file if needed as well (maxclients, etc).

You can edit the "motd.txt" file to display a message to connecting clients.
See the included one for line size information.

**************************
IMPORTANT!!!
**************************
The default settings in server.cfg include:
set public 1
setmaster q2master.planetquake.com

set logfile 2
set netlog ripper.planetquake.com:21998

The first two lines publish your server on the PlanetQuake master list so that
people can see it in GameSpy. If you don't want your server to be public, set 
public 0 and remove the setmaster line.

The second two lines enable net logging. See below for net logging info.
If you are running on a LAN and not connected to the Internet, REMOVE THESE LINES!!
If the server crashes after the first frag, then it is having trouble sending the
net logging info and you should turn net logging off.

--------------
Server Crashes
--------------
Server crashes will not be tolerated! RA2 has been designed and tested to be
a highly reliable mod. If you are experiencing server crashes. please contact
me asap so we can track down the cause. If you have physical access to the server,
the following info would be useful following a crash:
1. The full text of the "Details" box on the crash dialog
2. The text on the console at the time of crash
3. The qconsole.log file in the arena directory after the crash (deleted
when the server is restared, so grab it fast!)
4. The drwatson32.log file (in your winnt directory) if on Windows NT

--------------------------
Administration / Mod setup
--------------------------
There are several console variables which control how the mod functions.
Most other options have been moved to the arena.cfg file.

"set logfile 2" will instruct RA2 create an standard log file.
If no additional options are specified, it will create the file "stdlog.log" in
your \quake2\arena directory. You can add "set logname mylog.log" to use a different
filename
mation.

"set admincode 1234" is the code (up to 8 digits) that you set to allow in-game
administration of the server.

"set netlog ripper.planetquake.com:21998" will send all logging information to that
machine. See below for net logging information.

"set public 1" will allow the server to be displayed on the id list. You MUST set
public 1 for your netlog stats to be accepted.


--------------
arena.cfg file
--------------
The arena.cfg file allows you to specify map options on a:
1. per server
2. per map
3. per arena
basis
Information is stored in a hierarchical format. Priority goes in order to:
1. Values for the specific arena
2. Values for that map
3. Global values defined at the top of the arena.cfg file
4. Default values stored in the game code.

The format of the file is (note that the < > characters are not typed!):
<global default option>;
<global default option>;
<mapname> {
//comment
	<map default option>;
	<map default option>;
	<map default option>;
	<arena number> {
			<arena default option>;
			<arena default option>;
			<arena default option>;
	}
	<arena number> {
			<arena default option>;
	}
}

For example:
//-----------START OF FILE------------
maploop: ra2map1 ra2map3 ra2map5 q2dm1; // <-- sets the map rotation for the server
minping: 150; // <-- sets the default minimum ping to 150 for all arenas
ra2map1 {    // <-- ra2map1 is the map name
		weapons: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9; //<-- these will be the default weapons, if none are specified for an arena
		armor: 200; //<-- default health if none is specified
		health: 100; //<-- default armor
	1 {
		weapons: 2 3 4 5 6 7 9; //<-- arena 1 takes out hyperblaster
		armor: 100;  //<-- reduces default armor to 100
		playersperteam: 2; //<-- 2v2 matches
		rounds: 3; //<-- 2 out of 3 rounds wins the match
	}
	2 {
		weapons: 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0; //<-- all weapons allowed
		armor: 150; //<-- only 150 armor
		health: 90; //<-- 90 health to start
		pickup: 1; //<-- designates this as a pickup arena
		rounds: 9; //<-- 5 out of 9 rounds takes the match
	}
	3 {
		minping: 0; //<-- overrides the minping:150 set on the server. Everyone can play here
	}
	4 {
		weapons: 0; //<-- only blaster and BFG are allowed
		health: 500; //<-- start with a ton of health
		armor: 500; //<-- and lots of armor
		cells: 999; //<-- starting cells is 999 now
	}
//you do not need to list all the maps/arenas, unlisted ones will use defaults
}
q2dm8 {
		minping: 0; //all people allowed on this map. Overrides global 150 value

If your settings are not being used, please make sure that:
1. you have a ":" (colon) seperating the identifier and the value
2. you have a ";" (semi-colon) at the end each line

Pickup Teams
------------
Rocket Arena 2 now supports Clan Arena style pickup teams.
Simply set "pickup: 1;" for any arena/map you want to have pickup teams on.
Two teams will appear on the main menu (arena # red/arena # blue), and players 
will be able to join one of the teams and instantly be put in the arena.

You should also set multiple rounds "rounds: 9;" or so, so that the matches
last a bit longer. There is a 15 second waiting period between matches, so
that players can switch teams if they want.



------------
Net Logging
------------
Rocket Arena 2 has network logging support. To enable this add:
"set public 1" and
"set netlog ripper.stanford.edu:21998" in your server.cfg file.
This will send kill information to that machine for central collection
and analysis. This system is not 100% reliable (about 1/1000 kills are
lost in transit) but is STRICTLY FOR FUN, so if you're looking for more
serious/accurate rankings, do them for your own server only.

Right now all I am doing with the netlog data is displaying the top 5 
fraggers of the day on the top of the Rocket Arena page. Future uses may
be considered. The comprehensive stats were dicontinued because they fostered
an environment of intense competition that made many people uncomfortable.

----------------------
In Game Administration
----------------------
To use the in game administration, just type /cmd admin <admincode>
(e.g. /cmd admin 1234)

It will pop up a menu allowing you to select things like fraglimit, timelimit,
and map. You can cycle through all the maps in the maploop: line in the arena.cfg file.
Use invuse (ENTER) to increment a value and invdrop (') to decrease it.

Arena administration is done by typeing: /cmd arenaadmin <admincode> <arena #>
(e.g. /cmd arenaadmin 1234 1)
This will give you a menu similar to the voting menu, but you can force the changes.

Also, there is a new option on the Arena Admin menu only in this version.
You can "lock" an arena. This is to allow clans to have matches on a server without
the rcon code. To use this, have all of the players in the game enter the arena, then
have the admin "lock" the arena on the menu. No players will be able to enter that 
arena until it is "unlocked" (or all players leave the arena, in which case it will
be reset/unlocked).

-------
Grapple
-------
An offhand grapple is included in this version at the request of several
CTF players who like to train with RA2. To be honest, the majority of 
RA2 players are against the grapple, and it may even "break" some maps.

I don't recommend turning the grapple on on public servers, but if you do,
PLEASE put something in the server title to that effect.
